1. The registry cannot modified with the a non admin user, and letting the Test Script run as admin was not a really
option. So the workaround is to make use of windows runas.exe tool. We run reg.exe with runas.exe /u:admin....
But the password for admin needs to be saved first. So before running the test execute this commands once:

Start cmd.exe as Admin:

Net user administrator 12345
Net user administrator /active:yes

runas /u:administrator /savecred reg

Enter your password and thats it, from now on the admin pass is saved!
Whenever runas.exe is with option /savecred the password will not be prompted again!
